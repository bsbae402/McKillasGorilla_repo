static const wstring	LEVEL1START1 = L"Rebelle: Henry? Abigail? Lili? Kolaka? Are you there?";
static const wstring	LEVEL1START2 = L"Kolaka: I still have the communication open. I hear you all in my mind right now.";
static const wstring	LEVEL1START3 = L"Abigail: Right. We've made it outside too. Though too many of Mr. Smithy's men arrived, \nand we barely stole any money in our time here.";
static const wstring	LEVEL1START4 = L"Rebelle: I guess when your town is owned by some greedy criminal, it's no surprise when \nhe gets protective of all the money he's forced from the town for himself.";
static const wstring	LEVEL1START5 = L"Henry: Sounds like someone wants to make a public withdrawl from Smithy's wallet, huh?";
static const wstring	LEVEL1START6 = L"Lili: Why withdraw when you can just steal the wallet?";
static const wstring	LEVEL1START7 = L"Abigail: For now, just focus on meeting us outside at the end of this room, Rebelle. Of \ncourse, do pick up whatever cash you find for us.";
static const wstring	LEVEL1START8 = L"Lili: I marked the end for you. It's that little purple area in the corner. Just use the \nU key if you wanna look around this level for where to go.";
static const wstring	LEVEL1START9 = L"Kolaka: But be careful. Some of Smithy's men are looking for you. I guess after we gave \nsome of them a beating during our escape, you're naturally guilty by association.";
static const wstring	LEVEL1START10 = L"Lili: Yep. The team goes free and the leader takes the bullets. I'm glad I'm not you.";
static const wstring	LEVEL1START11 = L"Rebelle: Hang on. You actually hurt his men? Even after I told you to avoid violence?";
static const wstring	LEVEL1START12 = L"Henry: We didn't kill them, if that's what you're thinking. We tried, but I left my good \npistol in the car.";
static const wstring	LEVEL1START13 = L"Rebelle: Not killing doesn't justify wanting to kill.";
static const wstring	LEVEL1START14 = L"Lili: So you're still a wussy pascifist? Well, now I'm REALLY glad I'm not you.";
static const wstring	LEVEL1START15 = L"Rebelle: Look, just wait 'til I get to the end of this level, then we can talk about it.";

static const wstring	LEVEL1FOUNDENEMY1 = L"Lili: Rebelle! Look! It's one of Smithy's men up ahead.";
static const wstring	LEVEL1FOUNDENEMY2 = L"Rebelle: Oh! Thanks for the alert. I'd better stay out of sight and avoid trouble.";
static const wstring	LEVEL1FOUNDENEMY3 = L"Lili: No! Not YOUR thing. Attack the guy and get him out of your way.";
static const wstring	LEVEL1FOUNDENEMY4 = L"Rebelle: He's just doing his job. He doesn't need anyone ruining his day.";
static const wstring	LEVEL1FOUNDENEMY5 = L"Henry: Well, if you could do YOUR job and help us, just shoot enemies with the F Key.";
static const wstring	LEVEL1FOUNDENEMY6 = L"Rebelle: You mean, use my ability to weaken whatever I touch to shoot without killing \n them. I can do that by holding the safety key and press the F Key.";
static const wstring	LEVEL1FOUNDENEMY7 = L"Henry: Hey, who's the weapons expert here? Me or you?";
static const wstring	LEVEL1FOUNDENEMY8 = L"Rebelle: Did you forget that if I kill someone, it's an automatic game over? And also, \nit's wrong?";
static const wstring	LEVEL1FOUNDENEMY9 = L"Lili: Uh, I checked. That won't happen anymore . . . probably.";
static const wstring	LEVEL1FOUNDENEMY10 = L"Kolaka: But if you think shooting's too easy and wanna try your luck, you can also \n punch enemies. If you punch 'em three times, they'll go down. Just press the G Key to punch.";
static const wstring	LEVEL1FOUNDENEMY11 = L"Rebelle: You mean, hold the safety key and hit the G Key to punch.";
static const wstring	LEVEL1FOUNDENEMY12 = L"Kolaka: Hey, who's the muscle of the group? Me or you?";
static const wstring	LEVEL1FOUNDENEMY13 = L"Rebelle: But if I punch someone without the safety on, I lose 100 points. And do I \n need to mention the game over that happens with no safety again?";
static const wstring	LEVEL1FOUNDENEMY14 = L"Abigail: Why would you want to use that safety key? It's always changing and you \n might not be able to safely hurt someone even if you tried. Why make it harder?";
static const wstring	LEVEL1FOUNDENEMY15 = L"Rebelle: Just 'cause it's harder to do the right thing, don't mean it's right to do \nthe wrong thing.";

static const wstring	LEVEL1MONEY1 = L"Henry: Nice! We got some money!";
static const wstring	LEVEL1MONEY2 = L"Rebelle: Yes! I know some poor folks in town who could really use this.";
static const wstring	LEVEL1MONEY3 = L"Kolaka: You're talking about us, right?";
static const wstring	LEVEL1MONEY4 = L"Abigail: Elora, please! We've all worked hard to fight against Smithy. We should at least \n be the ones to benefit from doing so.";
static const wstring	LEVEL1MONEY5 = L"Rebelle: I know who needs it, and it's not us. Now, to donate money, I just have to press \n the ESCAPE Key to pause and go to the donate screen.";
static const wstring	LEVEL1MONEY6 = L"Rebelle: The more money I donate, the higher score we get.See ? Sometimes, doing what's right is rewarded.";
static const wstring	LEVEL1MONEY7 = L"Henry: Ugh. Why are we friends with you again?";
static const wstring	LEVEL1MONEY8 = L"Lili: Just a moment there! Sure. You could give the money away. Or maybe you could put it \n to good use.";
static const wstring	LEVEL1MONEY9 = L"Rebelle: Oh?";
static const wstring	LEVEL1MONEY10 = L"Lili: Just go to the upgrade page in the pause screen, and I can sell you some tools for \n boosting your Attack, Defense, and Speed.";
static const wstring	LEVEL1MONEY11 = L"Lili: If you have the money, just select an upgrade. To use it, you can then hit CTRL W to \n increase your attack power, CTRL A to increase your defense, and CTRL S to increase your speed.";
static const wstring	LEVEL1MONEY12 = L"Rebelle: Why do I need to pay you for this? Aren't you supposed to help me?";
static const wstring	LEVEL1MONEY13 = L"Lili: Well, yeah, but I need the dough to cover some expenses. You get it. Right?";
static const wstring	LEVEL1MONEY14 = L"Rebelle: Hmm. You're not trying to do what Smithy did to us earlier, are you, Miss \n Con-Artist of the team?";
static const wstring	LEVEL1MONEY15 = L"Lili: Heavens no! Oh, but just a disclaimer, Lili Rivera is not responsible for any \n sudden deactivation of upgrades in the field of battle. All sales are final!";

static const wstring	LEVEL1HEAL1 = L"Rebelle: Oh no! He's hurt!";
static const wstring	LEVEL1HEAL2 = L"Kolaka: Sorry. I wasn't looking. Did you get him, or did I?";
static const wstring	LEVEL1HEAL3 = L"Rebelle: Okay. No problem. For any injured enemies, I can just heal them by pressing \n the H Key.";
static const wstring	LEVEL1HEAL4 = L"Henry: Okay. We can do that. But let's make one change where we don't do anything you \n suggest regarding people we don't like who are hurt.";
static const wstring	LEVEL1HEAL5 = L"Rebelle: I can't just leave him lying here.";
static const wstring	LEVEL1HEAL6 = L"Lili: Come on. It's not that hard.";
static const wstring	LEVEL1HEAL7 = L"Abigail: You heal him and he's going to be after you. Don't expect him to politely ask \n to shoot you.";
static const wstring	LEVEL1HEAL8 = L"Rebelle: Then I'll be quick. And I'll even get some more points for it.";
static const wstring	LEVEL1HEAL9 = L"Henry: And how long until this move kills you?";

static const wstring	MISCA1 = L"Abigail: Elora, you'd better not hold back against these guys. I've taken self-defense, and \n they say hurting your attacker is completely acceptable.";
static const wstring	MISCA2 = L"Lili: And if you'd like to attack before they do, just hit G to punch or F to shoot and ignore \n that safety key. I'm sure they'd appreciate the challenge.";
static const wstring	MISCB1 = L"Henry: Come on, Rebelle, just think of all the great shooting games that exist. Do any of them make you care about your enemies? \n Just kill 'em and leave. And yes, I know none of those games exist here in 1909, but I still know they're more fun.";
static const wstring	MISCC1 = L"Kolaka: As a member of the Helawi tribe, I'm all for going with peace when dealing with \n jerks, but even I have limits.";
static const wstring	MISCC2 = L"Abigail: And my dad is one of Smithy's mercenaries. Do you think I have a problem with hurting \n his associates? We're fine with ditching the safety and you should be too.";
static const wstring	MISCD1 = L"Lili: This is just a reminder that Lili's Upgrade Store is still open for all your money \n spending for upgrade needs. Don't be pressured to give your cash away. Come on down to Lili's in the 'Show Upgrades' section of the pause menu.";
static const wstring	MISCD2 = L"Rebelle: Isn't that the button above the donation section? 'Cause that's where I'm heading.";
static const wstring	MISCD3 = L"Lili: Gah! Stupid competition! Charity gets all the money we don't.";
static const wstring	MISCE1 = L"Lili: Elora, this is your conscience. Don't use your safety ability. That changing safety key is \n dishonest. Kill your enemies to keep them from coming after you and your friends, particularly Lili, the smartest and cutest friend you'll ever have.";
static const wstring	MISCE2 = L"Kolaka: Kolaka to Rebelle. Sorry. Did I put the communication on? I think Lili was just trying it.";
static const wstring	MISCE3 = L"Lili: Oh, thanks a lot, Kolaka. I almost had her.";
static const wstring	MISCE4 = L"Rebelle: You know I can see your names at the bottom of the screen there.";
static const wstring	MISCF1 = L"Kolaka: Just remember. It's F to shoot and G to punch. And if you want, to attack without \n killing, hold the safety key, and to heal an enemy, approach him and press H.";
static const wstring	MISCF2 = L"Henry: Oh, and do us a favor. DON'T want that.";
static const wstring	MISCG1 = L"Abigail: If you see an enemy lying injured, don't bother using the H key to heal him. My dad says \n Smithy has a ton of medics. The mercenaries get great health coverage.";
static const wstring	MISCH1 = L"Lili: If you see money on the ground, don't just throw it away by going to the donate screen and selecting an amount to give away to \n add ten times that amount to your score. Come on down to Lili's and buy an upgrade for the low low price of 200 dollars a piece!";
